# AI Writing Assistant

This project is an **AI Writing Assistant** that uses Groq's API to summarize and rewrite text, checks for basic plagiarism, and saves the writing history in a SQLite database. It helps users improve their writing by providing concise summaries, professional rewrites, and plagiarism detection.

## Features
- **Summarize Text**: Generate concise summaries of input paragraphs using Groq's API.
- **Rewrite Text**: Rewrite paragraphs in a clearer, more professional tone.
- **Basic Plagiarism Check**: Detect common phrases that might indicate plagiarism.
- **Save Writing History**: Store original text, summaries, and rewritten versions in a SQLite database.
- **View History**: Retrieve and display past writing records with timestamps.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, you need:
- Python 3.6 or higher
- A Groq API key (Obtain from [https://console.groq.com/keys](https://console.groq.com/keys))
- Required Python libraries: `requests`, `sqlite3` (included in Python), `datetime`, `time`

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>
2. Install Dependencies: Install the required Python library requests using pip:
   pip install requests
4. Set Up Your Groq API Key:
5. Replace "‡¶Ü‡¶™‡¶®‡¶æ‡¶∞ API ‡¶ï‡ßÄ" in the code with your actual Groq API key:

GROK_API_KEY = "your_groq_api_key"
You can obtain your API key from https://console.groq.com/keys.
## Usage
Run the Script: Execute the Python script to start the AI Writing Assistant:
bash

##  python ai_writing_assistant.py
Interact with the Assistant:
The script will prompt you to enter a paragraph:

üß† Welcome to AI Writing Assistant (Powered by Groq)!
‚úçÔ∏è Enter your paragraph:
Input your text (e.g., "Education is the key to success in life.") and press Enter.
View Results: The assistant will:
Generate a summary of your text.
Rewrite your text in a professional tone.
Check for basic plagiarism.
Save the results to a SQLite database (writing_history.db).
Display the summary, rewritten text, and plagiarism report:

üîç Generating summary...
üìö Summary: Education is essential for achieving success in life.
üîÅ Rewriting for clarity...
üîÅ Rewritten: Education serves as the fundamental pathway to achieving success in life.
üïµÔ∏è Checking basic plagiarism...
‚ö†Ô∏è Plagiarism Report: ‚ö†Ô∏è Possible Plagiarism Detected in these lines:
Education is the key to success
‚úÖ Writing saved to your personal history.
View Writing History (Optional):
Uncomment the show_history() call at the end of the script to view all saved writing records:

This will display all past entries with timestamps.
Code Structure
## API Integration:
Uses Groq's API (https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions) with the llama3-8b-8192 model for summarization and rewriting.
Includes a retry mechanism to handle rate limit errors (429 Too Many Requests).
## Functions:
summarize_text(): Summarizes input text.
rewrite_text(): Rewrites text in a professional tone.
check_basic_plagiarism(): Checks for common phrases that might indicate plagiarism.
save_to_db(): Saves results to a SQLite database.
show_history(): Displays writing history.
ai_writing_assistant(): Main function to run the assistant.
## Database
The script creates a SQLite database named writing_history.db.
It contains a table writings with the following columns:
id: Auto-incremented primary key.
input_text: Original input text.
summary: Summarized text.
rewritten_text: Rewritten text.
timestamp: Date and time of the entry.
## Limitations
Plagiarism Checker: The plagiarism detection is basic and only checks for a predefined list of common phrases.
Rate Limits: Groq's API has rate limits (e.g., 1 request/second, 60 or 1200 requests/hour depending on the model). The script includes a retry mechanism to handle rate limit errors.
Model Dependency: The script uses the llama3-8b-8192 model. Check Groq's documentation for other supported models if needed.
Troubleshooting
## API Key Error:
If you get a 401 Unauthorized error, ensure your Groq API key is correct. Generate a new key from https://console.groq.com/keys if needed.
Rate Limit Error:
If you encounter a 429 Too Many Requests error, the script will automatically retry after a delay. If the issue persists, contact Groq to increase your rate limit.
Model Error:
If the llama3-8b-8192 model is unavailable, check Groq's documentation for supported models and update the model field in the payload.
